## Functionality Overview

The feature extraction module provides the following functionality:

1. **Google Drive Integration**:

   - Downloads preprocessed datasets from Google Drive
   - Authenticates using OAuth2
   - Handles downloading large datasets efficiently

2. **Tokenization**:

   - Uses the model's tokenizer to convert text to tokens
   - Handles differences between encoder-decoder and causal LMs
   - Creates proper labels for training (shifted tokens for causal LMs)
   - Handles padding and truncation

3. **Memory Efficiency**:

   - Processes datasets in batches to avoid OOM errors
   - Removes original columns after tokenization to save memory
   - Supports parallel processing for faster extraction

4. **Robustness**:

   - Handles missing or alternative text columns
   - Tries to find appropriate text data in any column if needed
   - Handles various dataset formats and structures

5. **Training Integration**:
   - Saves processed features in a format ready for training
   - Integrates with the existing training pipeline
   - Supports configurable parameters like sequence length, batch size, etc.

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```bash
./scripts/prepare_drive_datasets.sh --text
```

This will:

1. Download text datasets from Google Drive
2. Extract features using the FLAN-UL2 tokenizer
3. Save the processed features to disk

### Code Generation

```bash
./train_deepseek_coder.sh
```

This will:

1. Extract features from code datasets using the DeepSeek-Coder tokenizer
2. Train a DeepSeek-Coder model using the extracted features
3. Save the trained model and metrics

### Custom Configuration

```bash
./scripts/prepare_drive_datasets.sh \
    --model_name "deepseek-ai/deepseek-coder-1.3b-base" \
    --max_length 1024 \
    --batch_size 2000 \
    --num_proc 8 \
    --drive_base_dir "MyCustomProject"
```

This allows for customization of the feature extraction process with different models, sequence lengths, batch sizes, etc.

## Integration with Training Pipeline

The feature extraction module is designed to integrate seamlessly with the existing training pipeline:

1. It's run as a preprocessing step before training
2. It saves processed features in a format that can be loaded directly for training
3. It automatically handles differences between model types (encoder-decoder vs. causal LM)
4. It uses the same configuration files as the training process for consistency

Jarvis AI Assistant Integration Module

This module provides the integration point between the Jarvis AI Assistant
and the user interface. It defines the JarvisAI class that handles natural
language processing and response generation.

This is a template implementation that should be replaced with your actual
Jarvis AI implementation. The template provides basic functionality to demonstrate
the integration pattern, but lacks advanced AI capabilities.

Integration Requirements:
1. Maintain the JarvisAI class with the same interface
2. Implement the process_query method that takes a string query and returns a string response
3. Handle initialization and model loading in the __init__ method

    This is a sample implementation that should be replaced with your actual

    the same interface to ensure compatibility with the UI.

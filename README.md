# Jarvis AI Assistant â€“ Unified Generative AI Modules

## Overview

The Jarvis AI Assistant is a multifaceted project integrating advanced AI capabilities, including image generation, text generation, and conversational AI. This documentation provides a detailed overview of the Generative AI modules:

* **Image Generation Module**: Transforms textual prompts into high-quality images using state-of-the-art diffusion models.
* **Text Generation Module**: Produces coherent and contextually relevant text based on user inputs, leveraging advanced language models.
* **Conversational AI Module**: Engages in dynamic, context-aware conversations with users, maintaining session histories and allowing for session management.

## Image Generation Module

### Features

* **High-Quality Image Synthesis**: Generates images from textual descriptions using the Stable Diffusion XL model.
* **Asynchronous Processing**: Utilizes asynchronous programming to handle multiple image generation requests efficiently.
* **Automated Display**: Automatically opens and displays generated images upon completion.

### Setup & Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/noah-mclain/Jarvis-AI-Assistant.git
   cd Jarvis-AI-Assistant
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed. Then, install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure API Access**:

   * Obtain an API key from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/).
   * Create a `.env` file in the project root directory and add your API key:

     ```
     HuggingFaceAPIKey=your_api_key_here
     ```

### Usage

Run the image generation script:

```bash
python ImageGeneration.py
```

The script monitors for image generation requests and processes them accordingly. Generated images are saved in the `Data` directory and displayed automatically.

### Sample Outputs

Below are examples of images generated by the module:

![Sample Image 1](Data/sample_image_1.jpg)
![Sample Image 2](Data/sample_image_2.jpg)
![Sample Image 3](Data/sample_image_3.jpg)
![Sample Image 4](Data/sample_image_4.jpg)

*Note: Replace the above image paths with the actual paths to your generated images.*

## Text Generation Module

### Features

* **Contextual Text Generation**: Produces text that is coherent and contextually aligned with the input prompt.
* **Customizable Parameters**: Allows adjustment of generation parameters such as temperature and maximum length.
* **Integration Ready**: Designed for easy integration into larger applications or conversational agents.

### Setup & Installation

1. **Navigate to the Text Module Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd Jarvis-AI-Assistant/gen-ai-text
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed. Then, install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure API Access**:

   * Obtain an API key from [OpenAI](https://openai.com/).
   * Create a `.env` file in the `gen-ai-text` directory and add your API key:

     ```
     OpenAI_API_Key=your_api_key_here
     ```

### Usage

Run the text generation script:

```bash
python text_generation.py
```

Upon running, the script will prompt you to enter a text prompt. It will then generate and display the corresponding output.

## Conversational AI Module

### Features

* **Gemini-2.0-Flash Integration**: Utilizes Google's latest Gemini Flash model for rapid and context-aware responses.
* **Contextual Conversations**: Maintains context within each chat session, allowing for coherent multi-turn dialogues.
* **Session Management**:

  * Create multiple named chat sessions.
  * Switch between active sessions.
  * Delete existing sessions.
  * Save/load sessions to JSON files.
* **Conversation History**:

  * Edit previous inputs/responses.
  * View complete conversation history.
  * Automatic timestamping of interactions.
* **Advanced Features**:

  * Session Merging: Combine loaded sessions with existing chats.
  * Error Handling: Robust mechanisms to handle API errors and invalid inputs.

### Setup & Installation

1. **Navigate to the Conversation Module Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd Jarvis-AI-Assistant/conversation
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed. Then, install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure API Access**:

   * Obtain an API key from [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
   * Set up authentication as per Google's Gemini API requirements.

### Usage

Run the conversational interface:

```bash
python conversation_interface.py
```

Follow the on-screen prompts to interact with the assistant. You can create new sessions, switch between sessions, and manage conversation histories.

## Converting Documentation to PDF

To convert this README into a PDF, follow these steps:

1. **Install Markdown to PDF Converter**:
   You can use tools like `pandoc` or `markdown-pdf`. For example, to install `markdown-pdf`:

   ```bash
   npm install -g markdown-pdf
   ```

2. **Convert README to PDF**:
   Navigate to the directory containing the `README.md` file and run:

   ```bash
   markdown-pdf README.md
   ```

   This will generate a `README.pdf` file in the same directory.

*Note: Ensure that all image paths in the markdown file are correct and accessible to have them included in the PDF.*
